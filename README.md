# Air Simulator

Visualise air pressure waves

a grid represents the space.

each grid space has a number representing the "pressure" at that location

each animation frame spaces check their neighbors' pressure and try to equalize pressure by transferring it to neighbors with lower pressure

pressure transfer should happen based on the difference between spaces

speed of pressure transfer (maybe the max pressure a square can give up per frame) maybe should be limited

represent objects as squares with "pressure" that cannot be transferred.
